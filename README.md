This Web Scraping & Text Analysis project utilizes Python library PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to retrieve and extract posts and comments from subreddits, Reddit API credentials from Reddit's Developer Portal is required to run PRAW. 

By analysing the harvested text, we are hoping to organize, understand and gain additional insights from it. There are 4 major practice areas of **Text Analytics**:
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Document clustering
3. Document classification
4. Sentiment analysis

**Preprocessing** is often neccessary for text analytics tasks. The process to clean is highly customizable and users will have to decide how much preprocessing is needed. Preprorcessing tasks includes:
- Case normalization
- Tokenization
- n-grams and skip-grams
- Removing unwanted characters/numbers
- Stemming and lemmatizing
- Spell checking
- Removing stop words
- Removing common and rare words

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Descriptive Statistics, looking into r/wallstreetbets, who played a major role in the GameStop short squeeze that caused significant losses for a number of US hedge funds and short sellers for a duration of time in early 2021. 
You will also find analysis of other interesting topics about philosophy, ethics, and religion. 

**Note**: The findings from this analysis may not reflect the views of the overall population, nor necessarily my own.

Thank you for reading :)
